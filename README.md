# UK Panel Show Gender Breakdown

Generally, [panel shows on UK television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UK_game_shows#Panel_games) include few female guests. Most have male __hosts__ and male __captains__/__regulars__. Even omitting the __regulars__, the guests are mostly men too. It is a problem that half the population are under-represented in these long-running TV and radio shows.

Is the situation really that bad? In short, yes. I've compiled some statistics for current, long-running, shows from [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/) (and other sources) to illustrate the point. Many of the panel shows listed below are comedy shows and I've made a non-exhaustive [list of funny women](http://strudel.org.uk/panelshows/women.html) to provide inspiration for the show makers.
