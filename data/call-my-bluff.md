__Call My Bluff__ has been running since the 1960s and we are missing most of the episodes. One place to get data is the BBC's Genome Project which has digitised old copies of the __Radio Times__. Please help me go [through the archives](http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/search/0/20?order=desc&q=Call+my+bluff#search).
