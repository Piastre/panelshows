					<p>It seems there may have been at least <strong>423 shows</strong> and 2116 listed appearances. With 5 people per show, <a href="http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/hignfy/episodes/">Comedy.co.uk</a> has <strong>0% more appearances listed than required</strong> (and probably a similar percent of people) perhaps due to listing special guests.
