		<h2><a href="http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/mock_the_week/">Mock The Week</a> (BBC Two/Angst Productions; )</h2>
					<p>It seems there may have been at least <strong>127 shows</strong> and 898 listed appearances. With 7 people per show, <a href="http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/mock_the_week/">Comedy.co.uk</a> has <strong>1% more appearances listed than required</strong> (and probably a similar percent of people) perhaps due to listing special guests. The host/captains/regulars have included Hugh Dennis (Regular &times; 127), Dara O'Briain (Host &times; 127), Andy Parsons (Regular &times; 118), Frankie Boyle (Regular &times; 55, Panellist &times; 1), Russell Howard (Regular &times; 55), Ed Byrne (Panellist &times; 39), Chris Addison (Regular &times; 36, Panellist &times; 1), Milton Jones (Panellist &times; 31), Josh Widdicombe (Panellist &times; 20), Stewart Francis (Panellist &times; 14), Rob Beckett (Panellist &times; 13), Rory Bremner (Regular &times; 10).</p>
