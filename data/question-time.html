					<p>It seems there may have been at least <strong>1268 shows</strong> and 6806 listed appearances. With 6 people per show, <a href="http://www.lovegraphs.com/random/gender-equality/film-tv/panel-shows.html">lovegraphs.com</a> and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006t1q9">iPlayer</a> are <strong>missing at least 11% of appearances</strong> (and probably a similar percent of people). The host/captains/regulars have included <a href="../people/David_Dimbleby.html">David Dimbleby</a> (Host &times; 795), <a href="../people/Robin_Day.html">Robin Day</a> (Host &times; 297), <a href="../people/Peter_Sissons.html">Peter Sissons</a> (Host &times; 148).</p>

			<p>
<em>Question Time</em> has been running since 1979 so the summary is an average of the past 34 years. David Dimbleby points out that <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/feb/25/david-dimbleby-hits-back-dara-o-briain-gender-balance-panel-shows">44% of their panellists</a> (therefore 38% of appearances including the host) in the 2014 series were women so the gender split is better than the historic average. <em>Question Time</em> tends to take half its panel (3) from Parliament and, as that institution under-represents women, that will affect the overall numbers too.
