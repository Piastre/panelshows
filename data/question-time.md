__Question Time__ has been running since 1979 so the summary is an average of the past 34 years. David Dimbleby points out that [44% of their panellists](http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/feb/25/david-dimbleby-hits-back-dara-o-briain-gender-balance-panel-shows) (therefore 38% of appearances including the host) in the current series are women so the gender split is better than the historic average. __Question Time__ tends to take half its panel (3) from Parliament and, as that institution under-represents women, that will affect the overall numbers too.
