	<h1>Questions about the panel show stats</h1>
	<p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/astronomyblog">@astronomyblog</a></p>

	<h3 id="type">What is the difference between a comedy panel show and an 'other' panel show?</h3>
	<p>That can be difficult to call. I've tried to base it on if the show is primarily about having a laugh as opposed to primarily being about the competition/discussion and laughs also happen. <em>Have I Got News For You</em> and <em>The News Quiz</em> are mostly about being funny rather than the answer. <em>A Question of Sport</em> is more about the sport's knowledge/competition even if it can also be funny. <em>Call My Bluff</em>, whilst containing humour, could also have non-comedic definitions for words. As humour is very subjective, and everything doesn't fit into neat binaries, you may disagree on some classifications.</p>

	<h3 id="colours">Why are the genders not shown as pink and blue?</h3>
	<p>In short, because that is a constructed convention from some time around the 1930s. It is unhelpful. I wanted two other colours and my friend suggested green and purple. It happens that they are also the colours of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffragette">suffragettes</a>. Bonus!</p>

	<h3 id="gender">Why have you got 'other' as a gender in the key?</h3>
	<p>Because gender isn't binary. So I built in the option for people who don't identify as either male or female. The gender information is stored on an episode-by-episode basis to cover people expressing a different gender at different times in their life. If you have been on one of the panel shows and I've mis-gendered you at all, please <a href="https://twitter.com/astronomyblog">let me know</a> and I'll fix it.</p>
	<p>Having an <em>other</em> category also allows for appearances by groups where the people who make it up are not individually known from the listings. There are also two instances on <em>Have I Got News For You</em> where non-gendered, non-human contestants were included.</p>
