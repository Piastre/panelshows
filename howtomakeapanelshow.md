# How to construct a comedy panel show

Using data from [23 comedy panel shows](http://www.strudel.org.uk/panelshows/) let's look at how to make one.

## Choose a host

You need a 'neutral' host for the game. You could have a regularly changing host drawn from the population in an unbiased way. However, either because you think the viewer prefers consistency, or because that is how it has been done before, or because you want to give someone a regular job, you choose one host. You have at least a **78% chance** of picking a man for this role.

## Choose captains

Either because you think the viewer prefers consistency, or because that is how it has been done before, or because you want to give someone a regular job, you choose two regular captains. Let's face it, if the captains changed each episode they wouldn't seem like captains.

OK, so you have two captains. You could represent the general population here by making one female and one male but you have an **80% chance** of picking a man for each of these roles.

## Choose regular panellists

Now that you've assigned you (80% male) captains, you have four spaces for panellists. However, at this point, you may want to make some of those spaces reserved for specific regulars. These aren't the captains but you find them funny and you want to give them regular work. Alternatively, you can just give them roles outside of the teams altogether. You feel inspired by __I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue__, __Mock The Week__, __QI__, __Just A Minute__, __Shooting Stars__, and __The News Quiz__. If you choose to add regulars, you have a **95% chance** of making them men.

## Choose the panellists

On each show you now have 4 (or fewer) panellist positions to fill. Overall, you have a **69% chance** of using a man for a panellist role but can stretch up to **85% chance**.

## Add other people

Now that you've got your hosts, your team captains and your panellists you can add some extra regulars who aren't on either team e.g. __8 Out Of 10 Cats Does Countdown__ and __Shooting Stars__. These have a **56% chance** of being men.

## Explaining away criticism

You may have noticed that each choice is biased in favour of men. Although many people won't notice that the resulting show is **80%** male, some people will complain that you've discriminated against women. You don't feel that you are biased against women - you love women - so you will need ~~ways to ignore them~~ responses.

* Firstly question the validity of any evidence showing a gender bias. This will get harder to do when the person has meticulously gone through counting up over 17,000 appearances in over 3,000 episodes of 23 different shows.
* Once the evidence showing more men than women becomes overwhelming you need to deflect the blame elsewhere. It isn't you that is at fault - it is the comedy circuit. Provide [anecdata](http://bethanyblack.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/dont-put-your-daughter-on-stage-mrs.html) that the comedy circuit is [at least 90% male](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/5712453/Interview-Dara-OBriain.html) based on your subjective experience of the industry. You are merely __reflecting__ the industry. You are not part of it. As a high profile TV or radio show you surely have no affect on who chooses to enter the industry at the bottom. 
* Your critics may point out that Chortle's big database of comedians actually show that the circuit is **83%** male not **>90%** as you previously asserted based on anecdata. In this case, try to find a specific niche for your show and dismiss Chortle's industry-wide list by saying that the particular subset you need is **>90%** male. Use anecdata to defend this number again. As a bonus, assert that there are minimum levels of (subjective) criteria such as talent, experience and popularity required. You think that men probably have more of these. Ignore this as an example of discrimination in favour of men.
* When critics provide a list of all the people who've appeared on a show and ask you to remove the ones (female and male) that don't meet the subjective criteria (despite the fact they were actually on the show) you may find that your resulting list is **24%** female. This is embarrasing. It shows that both your anecdata and Chortle's list actually __over-estimate__ the number of men in this specific part of the industry. At this point turn the blame onto the women themselves. Point out that at least two women have said that they don't like to go on these panel shows because of the ~~testosterone-fuelled one-upmanship~~ competitive atmosphere. Say that women don't like these __competitive environments__ so it is actually their fault for not being there. Ignore that, as a programme maker, you have chosen the environment that these two women don't like.
* If you are told that there is increasing evidence that men tend to think there are equal numbers of men and women when there are only 33% women, dismiss this as untrue, invented, or based on flimsy evidence even though you only just became aware of it. The fact that **75%** of people you follow on Twitter are men definitely doesn't demonstrate unconscious bias. That is just a fluke. The fact that you are a man is purely coincidental and, anyway, this evidence of unconscious bias is actually discrimination against men who are increasingly being made to allow equal opportunities to women.
* Mention that at least one person on the production team is a woman. We will assume that women either don't have unconscious bias or that they bias in favour of women despite the lack of evidence to back that up.
* Point out __Loose Women__ as evidence that everything balances out as it is __entirely__ made up of women. Ignore that this isn't a comedy panel show. Also ignore that its guests are about **60%** male showing a male-bias in an "all-female" show.

Ultimately, none of this is your fault. Even if there is a problem - which there isn't - it is someone else's fault. You only design the programme and choose who will be on them. You can't do anything about it. You love women. Some of your best friends are women. Your wife is one.
